# Reddit To Old Reddit
Changes every Reddit link you open to an old Reddit link (www.reddit.com/xyz to old.reddit.com/xyz).</br>
Thus effectively disables "Open in App" popup on Android.

    [Yandex](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.yandex.browser&hl=en&gl=US)</br>
2. Go to Menu â†’ Extensions.</br>
3. If "Developer Mode" or something similar is present, enable that.</br>
4. Follow any one based on case:</br>
   a. **If installation from packed option is present (Check for an option with: ".crx/.zip/.tar" written beside it.):**</br>
      i. Download the [Reddit to Old Reddit.crx](https://github.com/ltsRoy/Reddit-To-Old-Reddit/blob/c96d132dd3dcd94d48e0a3bfe9b8c58234329962/Reddit%20to%20Old%20Reddit.crx) file from the GitHub reposiory.</br>
      ii. Select the option in 4a.</br>
      iii. Navigate to the folder with the .crx file and select it.</br>
      iv. Go to Extensions and enable the extension if not already enabled, give the permissions it requires, if asked for.</br>
      v. Restart browser.</br>
      Done!</br></br>
   b. **If only installation from unpacked option is present:**</br>

      ii. Extract it.</br>
          (On Android, default "File Manager"s mostly can do it. If a tool is needed, use [ZArchiver](https://play.google.com/store/search?q=zarchiver&c=apps&hl=en&gl=US))</br> 
      iii. Select the option in 4b.</br>
      iv. Navigate and select the extracted folder from 4bii.</br>
